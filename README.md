# PIC18-FreeSpaceOptics
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Partner and I's capstone project. It features a half-duplex communication system based on free-space optical (FSO) technology. The system leverages laser diodes and phototransistors to transmit data wirelessly through light, utilizing PIC18 microcontrollers for control and signal processing.
